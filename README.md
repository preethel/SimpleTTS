# Speech-Typing
Speech-Typing is a Windows Forms application that allows you to type and hear the words as you type them. The application uses the System.Speech.Synthesis namespace to generate speech from text input, and captures keystrokes to read them out loud in real-time.

# Getting Started
To get started with Speech-Typing, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine, and open the solution file in Visual Studio. Build the solution and run the project to start using the application.

# Usage
Type in the text box and the application will speak out loud each keystroke you make. If you want to hear a sentence or a word in full, simply press the TTS button to generate speech from the text input.

The application also includes special handling for Caps Lock, Space, and various special characters, which are announced aloud when pressed.

# Requirements
* .NET Framework 4.8 or later
* Visual Studio 2022 or later
